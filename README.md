# RU Membership Database API

Every now and then I get an urge to play around with non-work code, and when I do that I try and make a membership system for Reading Ultimate. I pick a framework/language I've never used before and carry on until I get bored. This is version #?? of that.

Expect me to abandon this at some point.

But I might not, because RU's changing how we do things and a proper system may be a good idea. Also I've gone for a new approach this time rather than getting hung up of users/authentication and then getting bored of logging in all the time.
